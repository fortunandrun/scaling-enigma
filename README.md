# scaling-enigma
Project Start for the larger scale project to be considered.

So here's this:

To redefine identity management in such a way that counteracts human exploitation.


Local first, environment driven experiences and authority. 


The ability to log on anywhere on any machine as yourself (and plus virtually but there are a ton of people who are not even virtual.. so we have to factor that in... in fact some of the highest risk people are post-virtual, non-virtual, or virtual-limited)



To define populations at risk and maintain endpoints no matter where the location.




To get rid of passwords, because we all know that passwords are not a security feature. 




Building identity restructuring tools in for continuous integration of one self and/or the re-branding of one self.
